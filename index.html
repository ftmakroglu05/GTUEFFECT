				In order to support the psychological well-being of children affected by the earthquakes on February 6 centered in Kahramanmaraş and the earthquakes on February 20 centered in Hatay, Gebze Technical University (GTU) organized a science fair in Hatay's Defne District, Orhanlı, at Kocaeli Metropolitan Municipality Campsite, between July 10th and 13th, 2023. Workshops prepared considering the cognitive, physical, and social needs of each age group were conducted by GTU students under the coordination of GTU faculty members. The science fair, which was part of the third stage of post-disaster interventions, aimed to reduce the negative effects of the earthquake on children, while also providing GTU students, who were also affected by the earthquake indirectly, the positive effects of solidarity. The thematic workshops aimed to support the psychosocial well-being of earthquake-affected children, empower them, help them adapt to the new conditions after the effects of the disaster, and reduce the impact of trauma caused by the earthquake. Workshops designed for school-age children aimed to increase their motivation for education, address their learning needs, and enable them to realize the opportunities in the fascinating world of science based on their natural curiosity.  <a href="sciencefair.mp4" target="_blank"> video</a>

				WORKSHOPS</font>
<h4><a href="https://www.instagram.com/gturobotik/" target="_blank"> GTU Robotics and Automation Student Community</a>: In the robotics workshop, earthquake-affected children were introduced to the details of remote-controlled cars, which they enjoy playing with. Different age groups were given the opportunity to learn about the electronic and mechanical parts required for a remote-controlled car to function through interactive applications. They experienced these concepts through hands-on practice to ensure that the knowledge remains in their memories. Their questions were addressed to provide them with lasting knowledge. After this accumulation of knowledge, the most exciting part for the children came when they raced and had fun with the cars they examined and made together. Some decorated their cars with henna numbers, while others immortalized the moment with souvenir photos. It is hoped that they were able to discover their interests and leave touches that will allow them to set goals for the future, and that we were able to be exemplary engineers for our valuable students.<a href="rob1.mp4" target="_blank"> video1</a>, <a href="rob2.mp4" target="_blank"> video2</a></h4>
				<br> 	
				<h4><a href="https://www.instagram.com/gtu.kmk/"  target="_blank"> GTU Chemical Engineering Student Community </a>: In the chemistry workshops, a total of 6 different experiments on chemistry concepts in our daily lives were carried out according to age groups. For our 6-9-year-old students, workshops included inflating balloons with chemistry, acid-base determination with red cabbage indicator, and soap making, where participating students actively served as experiment assistants. At the end of the activity, we gifted the students soaps in different colors and shapes that we prepared in the Gebze Technical University Chemistry Laboratories. For our 10-15-year-old students, we organized workshops on Ivory soap, disappearing colors, and soap-making, which were completed with the assistance of students who won a introductory game or answered chemistry questions correctly. Throughout the applied workshops, fundamental chemistry concepts such as physical changes of matter, acid-base concepts, solubility, oxidation, and reduction reactions were interactively explained both theoretically and practically. The importance of chemistry in our daily lives among the applied fundamental sciences was highlighted, considering the knowledge levels of different age groups, through experiments.

				<h4><a href="https://www.instagram.com/gtumita/" target="_blank"> GTU Architecture and Design Student Community</a>:  When designing the "Role of Imagination" workshop, the aim was for children to design their own heroes, which differed from conventional products. This superhero represents the point the child wants to express. Different materials and uses were experienced to represent the special powers of the superhero. The relationship between colors and special powers reflected the child's imagination. Finally, we ended the workshop by telling the children to close their eyes and think about this superhero whenever they needed its special powers and to smile.

People don't always understand each other by talking. Sometimes, colors they choose, or brush strokes they make, can tell a lot. We gifted each student in the workshop with a superhero hidden in their imagination.
<a href="mita1.mp4" target="_blank"> video</a></h4>
				<br>			
				<h4><a href="https://matematikturkiye.com/" target="_blank"> Math Club of Turkiye </a>: Three different workshops were organized based on age groups in the mathematics workshops. In the Magic Squares workshop, we conducted studies on how to create magic squares, which are nxn squares with numbers written inside, where the sum of each column, row, and diagonal is equal, and discussed various methods used in creating magic squares. In the workshop where Platonic solids were formed with origami, the characteristics of Platonic solids were explained, and the participants experienced these solids three-dimensionally by folding papers. In the Nim game workshop, we played combinatorial games that do not involve chance and sought answers to the question of "Which games have a winning strategy? Is it possible to always win?" The students, through the workshops, started to see mathematics not only as a subject in school but also as an applicable field in daily life. It is expected that these activities will contribute to the development of young math enthusiasts.<a href="math1.mp4" target="_blank"> video</a></h4>
								<br> 		
				<h4><a href="https://www.instagram.com/gtumuzikvesanat/"  target="_blank"> GTU Music and Art Student Community</a>: A series of musical activities were organized inside the music club's event tent. Musical introduction games were used to start the activities, followed by interactive activities with body percussion and rhythm sticks for younger children. This allowed them to engage in a non-exhausting physical activity and develop a sense of rhythm. For middle school and older children, live music and karaoke activities were organized at the end of the day. While the music club members performed, participants were asked to accompany the songs with tambourines or rhythm sticks and were given the opportunity to sing with a microphone during karaoke. Although some initial stage fright was observed, as participants joined in with accompanying voices during karaoke, they became more relaxed, resulting in an increase in self-confidence. The activities aimed to develop the sense of rhythm and melody in children and increase their involvement in related activities.<a href="music1.mp4" target="_blank"> video</a></h4>
								<br>	
<h4><a href="https://www.instagram.com/gtulatindans/"  target="_blank"> GTU Latin Dance Student Community</a>: In this event for earthquake-affected children, the sports workshop provided them with an unforgettable experience with a specially designed obstacle course for different age groups. The course consisted of three different lanes with physical and mental obstacles, such as hula hoop hopping, puzzles, bowling, ring toss, and minefield. The children encountered these obstacles, enabling them to develop problem-solving skills, balance, coordination, and the ability to overcome challenges. They both worked individually to improve themselves and discovered the importance of teamwork by moving together with their friends. By participating in the workshop, the children gained awareness of their achievements, which increased their self-confidence and strengthened their ability to cope with future challenges.<a href="sport1.mp4" target="_blank"> video</a></h4>

	<h4><a href="https://www.instagram.com/gtuhadok/"  target="_blank"> GTU Animal and Nature Conservation Student Community</a>:The Colors of the Butterfly
During the workshop, various figures were drawn on the students using henna. This left a temporary physical mark, and the children were encouraged to make important decisions about themselves. Additionally, previously participating children were easier to recognize by us. 
There were also painting workshop for the children with the theme of 'Memories from the Science Fair.' The paintings created there were collected and brought to the university, and it is planned to open an exhibition. <a href="hadok1.mp4" target="_blank"> video</a></h4>

						<h2><img src="gtu1.png"  width="180" height="auto" class="img-rounded">Math Academy</h2><br>	
				The aim of this summer school is to provide an opportunity for undergraduate and preferably graduate and doctoral students of Mathematics (residing in or studying at universities in these provinces) in the 11 provinces affected by the earthquakes that occurred in our country on 6 February 2023 to think, interact and do mathematics again in a free mathematical environment. New developments in the theory of rings and modules, one of the most fundamental topics in abstract algebra, were given with the example of Leavitt path algebras, which have been an active research area in recent years. Participants will be informed about recent research and results in this area, and the necessary background will be provided for those who want to do research on this and similar topics. The lectures were given by experts who did the first studies on Leavitt path algebra in Turkey and who are still actively researching in this field. A total of 24 hours of lectures were given in 4 days, 6 hours each day.

<h4><a href="https://www.selcuk.edu.tr/Person/Detail/cvural"  target="_blank"> Dr. Vural Cam </a> (Selçuk University, Konya), <i>Concept of Socle, Jacobson Radical and Centers in Leavitt
Path Algebras</i>: 
Leavitt path algebras, an algebraic structure corresponding to directed graphs, a combinatorial object, has been of interest to many mathematicians since 2004. If we have an algebraic structure, we are interested in the algebraic properties of this structure. In these lectures, we will focus on the minimal (left) ideals of Leavitt path algebras, and we will examine the concept of socle, which is the sum of these ideals. Similarly, the concept of the Jacobson radical defined as the intersection of maximal (left)-ideals will be discussed and examined in the context of Leavitt path algebras. Finally, we will consider the centers of Leavitt path algebras.

<br> 
<h4><a href="https://yoksis.iku.edu.tr/public/education/MTA0MDA3MDU0MTI=" target="_blank"> Prof. Dr. Songül Esin</a> (Istanbul Kultur University, Turkey), <i>Ideals</i>: The aim of these lectures is to study the ideals of Leavitt path algebras.  First, two-sided ideals, maximal ideals, prime ideals and primitive ideals of a ring will be discussed. Since Leavitt path algebras are Z-graded, it is important to determine the structure and generators of the graded ideals. We will also consider ideals of Leavitt path algebras that are not graded. The structure of maximal ideals of Leavitt path algebras will be examined and the characterization of prime ideals will be given. We will prove that a graded ideal is an intersection of primitive ideals.  </h4>

				<h4><a href="https://akademik.yok.gov.tr/AkademikArama/view/viewAuthor.jsp" target="_blank"> Dr. Ayşe Tuğba Güroğlu</a> (Celal Bayar University, Manisa), <i>Artinian and Noetherian Rings</i>:The ascending chain condition (ACC) was first introduced by Emmy Noether and then the decending chain condition (DCC) was put forward by Emil Artin.  These are algebraic finiteness conditions. Rings that satisfy the ACC and respectively DCC condition on ideals are called Noetherian and respectively Artinian. Noetherian rings satisfy the maximum condition on ideals while Artinian rings satisfy the minimum condition, and these conditions coincide in some cases. In these lectures, we will first study the maximum and minimum conditions on ideals, prove fundamental theorems about them and provide examples. Then the relationship between Artinian and Noetherian rings and questions like whether these properties inherited by subrings and quotients        will be investigated. Necessary and sufficient conditions for LPAs to be Noetherian (or Artinian)  will be given in terms of combinatorial properties of a digraph $\Gamma$ and these will be explained with examples.  </h4>

				<h4><a href="https://sites.google.com/view/aytenkoc/home-page" target="_blank">  Assoc. Prof. Ayten Koç </a> (Gebze Technical University, Turkey), <i>Fundamental Definitions and Concepts</i>:  A Leavitt Path Algebra (abbreviated LPA) denoted by $L_\mathbb{F}(\Gamma)$, is an associative algebra whose generators and relations are determined by  a directed graph $\Gamma$. The first day's lectures will start with the definitions  of a directed graph, the pre-order "leads to" on the vertices, sinks, cycles, loops, finite and infinite paths, hereditary and saturated subsets of vertices, conditions K and L on $\Gamma$. Also, the semigroup of $\Gamma$ will be explained and the definition of LPA will be given, basic properties will be proven. Examples of some well-known algebras (such as matrix algebras, Laurent polynomial algebra, Jacobson-Toeplitz algebra, Leavitt algebras $L(1,n)$) will be realized as LPAs. Finally, a dictionary between combinatorial properties of  $\Gamma$ and  algebraic properties of  $L_\mathbb{F}(\Gamma)$ will be given. We will be working with finite digraphs and coefficients of algebra will be a field F.</h4>

				<h4><a href="https://math.ou.edu/profile?mozaydin"  target="_blank"> Prof. Dr. Murad Özaydın</a> (University of Oklahoma, Oklahoma, USA),<i>Quiver Representations and Categories of Modules</i>: Quiver representations in the modern approach are defined as a functor from the path category of a directed graph to vector spaces, but they can be defined using only linear transformations. They have been a fundamental concept of ring and module theory since the work of Gabriel and Auslander in the 1970s. Quiver representations of a directed graph are equivalent to the category of modules over the path algebra of that directed graph. The modules over  the Leavitt path algebra defined by the same directed graph correspond to the quiver representations satisfying a natural isomorphism condition. In these lectures, basic concepts such as (finitely generated) projective, simple, indecomposable modules will be defined and examined in the context of Leavitt path algebras and what is known about their classifications will be explained. In addition, the results obtained so far in the TUBITAK 1001 project 122F414 will be mentioned. If time permits, topics such as the categorical approach and introduction to Morita theory will also be covered, depending on the interest and the level of knowledge of the participants. </h4>
